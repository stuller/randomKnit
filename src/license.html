            * If you make money, so do I. You may not use this source
                in a way that earns you money if you are not also paying me
                and have arranged payment terms with me.
                This may sound harsh, but you can thank the tech bros at 
                ecomcrew.com for that. This app was not intended to be a
                moneymaker for me, but I'd rather not have some techbros that
                don't even know how to spell purl and have insulted the entire
                knitting community to make money off it either. 
            * If you make money, you will also donate a percentage of your 
                proceeds to the charity of my choice.
